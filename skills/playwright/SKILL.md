# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

Automate a real browser from the terminal using `playwright-cli`. Navigate pages, interact with elements, take screenshots, extract data, fill forms, test UI flows, manage sessions, and mock network requests. Run commands sequentially — each returns a snapshot of the current browser state for the next step.

## Prerequisites

Check if playwright-cli is available:

```bash
command -v playwright-cli >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "READY" || echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

## Choosing the Right Command

| Goal | Commands |
|------|---------|
| Open a browser or navigate | `open`, `goto`, `go-back`, `go-forward`, `reload` |
| Interact with elements | `click`, `fill`, `type`, `press`, `hover`, `drag`, `check`, `select`, `upload` |
| Capture page state | `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `pdf` |
| Manage tabs | `tab-new`, `tab-list`, `tab-select`, `tab-close` |
| Manage storage and sessions | `state-save`, `state-load`, `cookie-*`, `localstorage-*`, `sessionstorage-*` |
| Mock or inspect network | `route`, `unroute`, `route-list`, `network` |
| Inspect attributes or run JS | `eval`, `run-code`, `console` |
| Record video or traces | `video-start`, `video-chapter`, `video-stop`, `tracing-start`, `tracing-stop` |
| Handle dialogs | `dialog-accept`, `dialog-dismiss` |

playwright-cli route "https://api.example.com/**" --body='{"mock": true}'
playwright-cli route-list
playwright-cli unroute "**/*.jpg"
playwright-cli unroute
```

### DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli console warning
playwright-cli network
playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000

```

## Open parameters

```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge
# Connect to browser via extension
playwright-cli open --extension

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

Take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot`. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

Use css selectors or Playwright locators as alternatives to refs.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli network
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Rules

- **NEVER** use `eval` or `run-code` on untrusted page content — these execute arbitrary JavaScript.
- **NEVER** include real credentials in commands. Use placeholder values in examples.
- Use `eval` and `run-code` only on trusted pages.
- After every `playwright-cli screenshot` command, use the Read tool on the output file so the user can see it inline. Screenshots are invisible to the user unless the file is read.

## Output Format

Each command returns a snapshot of the current browser state:

```
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

`eval` returns the evaluated value directly:

```
"Example Domain"
```

`screenshot` returns the saved file path:

```
Screenshot saved to .playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-43-000Z.png
```

`console` returns captured log entries:

```
[log] Page loaded
[error] Failed to fetch /api/data
```

## Error Recovery

- `ref not found` / stale element ref → run `playwright-cli snapshot` to refresh refs, then retry
- `playwright-cli` not found → `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`
- Blank or crashed page → `playwright-cli close` then `playwright-cli open <url>` again
- Session lost → re-open the URL to start a new session
- Snapshot too large → use `playwright-cli snapshot --depth=3` to limit depth
