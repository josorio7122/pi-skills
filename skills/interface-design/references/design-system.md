# Design System Reference

## Token Architecture

Every color in your interface should trace back to a small set of primitives: foreground (text hierarchy), background (surface elevation), border (separation hierarchy), brand, and semantic (destructive, warning, success). No random hex values — everything maps to primitives.

### Text Hierarchy

Don't just have "text" and "gray text." Build four levels — primary, secondary, tertiary, muted. Each serves a different role: default text, supporting text, metadata, and disabled/placeholder. Use all four consistently. If you're only using two, your hierarchy is too flat.

### Border Progression

Borders aren't binary. Build a scale that matches intensity to importance — standard separation, softer separation, emphasis, maximum emphasis. Not every boundary deserves the same weight.

### Control Tokens

Form controls have specific needs. Don't reuse surface tokens — create dedicated ones for control backgrounds, control borders, and focus states. This lets you tune interactive elements independently from layout surfaces.

## Spacing

Pick a base unit and stick to multiples. Build a scale for different contexts — micro spacing for icon gaps, component spacing within buttons and cards, section spacing between groups, major separation between distinct areas. Random values signal no system.

---

## Padding

Keep it symmetrical. If one side has a value, others should match unless content naturally requires asymmetry.

---

## Depth

Choose ONE approach and commit:

- **Borders-only** — Clean, technical. For dense tools.
- **Subtle shadows** — Soft lift. For approachable products.
- **Layered shadows** — Premium, dimensional. For cards that need presence.
- **Surface color shifts** — Background tints establish hierarchy without shadows.

Don't mix approaches.

## Border Radius

Sharper feels technical. Rounder feels friendly. Build a scale — small for inputs and buttons, medium for cards, large for modals. Don't mix sharp and soft randomly.

---

## Typography

Build distinct levels distinguishable at a glance. Headlines need weight and tight tracking for presence. Body needs comfortable weight for readability. Labels need medium weight that works at smaller sizes. Data needs monospace with tabular number spacing for alignment. Don't rely on size alone — combine size, weight, and letter-spacing.

---

## Card Layouts

A metric card doesn't have to look like a plan card doesn't have to look like a settings card. Design each card's internal structure for its specific content — but keep the surface treatment consistent: same border weight, shadow depth, corner radius, padding scale.

---

## Controls

Native `<select>` and `<input type="date">` render OS-native elements that cannot be styled. Build custom components — trigger buttons with positioned dropdowns, calendar popovers, styled state management.

---

## Iconography

Icons clarify, not decorate — if removing an icon loses no meaning, remove it. Choose one icon set and stick with it. Give standalone icons presence with subtle background containers.

---

## Animation

Fast micro-interactions, smooth easing. Larger transitions can be slightly longer. Use deceleration easing. Avoid spring/bounce in professional interfaces.

---

## States

Every interactive element needs states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled. Data needs states too: loading, empty, error. Missing states feel broken.

---

## Navigation Context

Screens need grounding. A data table floating in space feels like a component demo, not a product. Include navigation showing where you are in the app, location indicators, and user context. When building sidebars, consider same background as main content with border separation rather than different colors.

---

## Dark Mode

Dark interfaces have different needs. Shadows are less visible on dark backgrounds — lean on borders for definition. Semantic colors (success, warning, error) often need slight desaturation. The hierarchy system still applies, just with inverted values.
