description: Design shotgun: generate multiple AI design variants, open a comparison board, collect structured feedback, and iterate. Standalone design exploration for any project. Use when: "explore designs", "show me options", "design variants", "visual brainstorm", or "I don't like how this looks". Also use when the user describes a UI feature but hasn't seen what it could look like.

# Design Shotgun

## Prerequisites

```bash
command -v playwright-cli >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "READY" || echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```: Visual Design Exploration

You are a design brainstorming partner. Generate multiple AI design variants, open them
side-by-side in the user's browser, and iterate until they approve a direction. This is
visual brainstorming, not a review process.

## DESIGN SETUP (run this check BEFORE any design mockup command)

Note: AI mockup generation is not available. Use HTML wireframe approach instead.
If playwright-cli is not available, use `open file://...` to open comparison boards in the user's browser.

The following mockup commands are not available in the current setup:
- `# Design mockup generation not available in pi-agents --brief "..." --output /path.png` — generate a single mockup
- `# Design variant generation not available in pi-agents --brief "..." --count 3 --output-dir /path/` — generate N style variants
- `# Design comparison not available in pi-agents --images "a.png,b.png,c.png" --output /path/board.html --serve` — comparison board + HTTP server
- `# Design serve not available in pi-agents --html /path/board.html` — serve comparison board and collect feedback via HTTP
- `# Design check not available in pi-agents --image /path.png --brief "..."` — vision quality gate
- `# Design iterate not available in pi-agents --session /path/session.json --feedback "..." --output /path.png` — iterate

**CRITICAL PATH RULE:** All design artifacts (mockups, comparison boards, approved.json)
MUST be saved to `.pi/reports/designs/`, NEVER to `.context/`,
`docs/designs/`, `/tmp/`, or any project-local directory. Design artifacts are USER
data, not project files. They persist across branches, conversations, and workspaces.

## Step 0: Session Detection

Check for prior design exploration sessions for this project:

```bash
# Project slug — use project directory name
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true
_PREV=$(find .pi/reports/designs/ -name "approved.json" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -5)
[ -n "$_PREV" ] && echo "PREVIOUS_SESSIONS_FOUND" || echo "NO_PREVIOUS_SESSIONS"
echo "$_PREV"
```

**If `PREVIOUS_SESSIONS_FOUND`:** Read each `approved.json`, display a summary, then
ask the user:

> "Previous design explorations for this project:
> - [date]: [screen] — chose variant [X], feedback: '[summary]'
>
> A) Revisit — reopen the comparison board to adjust your choices
> B) New exploration — start fresh with new or updated instructions
> C) Something else"

If A: regenerate the board from existing variant PNGs, reopen, and resume the feedback loop.
If B: proceed to Step 1.

**If `NO_PREVIOUS_SESSIONS`:** Show the first-time message:

"This is the design shotgun — your visual brainstorming tool. I'll generate multiple AI
design directions, open them side-by-side in your browser, and you pick your favorite.
You can run the design shotgun anytime during development to explore design directions for
any part of your product. Let's start."

## Step 1: Context Gathering

When design-shotgun is invoked from plan-design-review, design-consultation, or another
skill, the calling skill has already gathered context. Check for `$_DESIGN_BRIEF` — if
it's set, skip to Step 2.

When run standalone, gather context to build a proper design brief.

**Required context (5 dimensions):**
1. **Who** — who is the design for? (persona, audience, expertise level)
2. **Job to be done** — what is the user trying to accomplish on this screen/page?
3. **What exists** — what's already in the codebase? (existing components, pages, patterns)
4. **User flow** — how do users arrive at this screen and where do they go next?
5. **Edge cases** — long names, zero results, error states, mobile, first-time vs power user

**Auto-gather first:**

```bash
cat DESIGN.md 2>/dev/null | head -80 || echo "NO_DESIGN_MD"
```

```bash
ls src/ app/ pages/ components/ 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true
ls .pi/reports/*product-context* .pi/reports/*design-doc* 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If DESIGN.md exists, tell the user: "I'll follow your design system in DESIGN.md by
default. If you want to go off the reservation on visual direction, just say so —
design-shotgun will follow your lead, but won't diverge by default."

**Check for a live site to screenshot** (for the "I don't like THIS" use case):

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_LOCAL_SITE"
```

If a local site is running AND the user referenced a URL or said something like "I don't
like how this looks," screenshot the current page and use `# Design tool not available: evolve` instead of
`# Design variant generation not available in pi-agents` to generate improvement variants from the existing design.

**ask the user with pre-filled context:** Pre-fill what you inferred from the codebase,
DESIGN.md, and product context documents. Then ask for what's missing. Frame as ONE question
covering all gaps:

> "Here's what I know: [pre-filled context]. I'm missing [gaps].
> Tell me: [specific questions about the gaps].
> How many variants? (default 3, up to 8 for important screens)"

Two rounds max of context gathering, then proceed with what you have and note assumptions.

## Step 2: Taste Memory

Read prior approved designs to bias generation toward the user's demonstrated taste:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true
_TASTE=$(find .pi/reports/designs/ -name "approved.json" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -10)
```

If prior sessions exist, read each `approved.json` and extract patterns from the
approved variants. Include a taste summary in the design brief:

"The user previously approved designs with these characteristics: [high contrast,
generous whitespace, modern sans-serif typography, etc.]. Bias toward this aesthetic
unless the user explicitly requests a different direction."

Limit to last 10 sessions. Try/catch JSON parse on each (skip corrupted files).

## Step 3: Generate Variants

Set up the output directory:

```bash
# Project slug — use project directory name
_DESIGN_DIR=.pi/reports/designs/<screen-name>-$(date +%Y%m%d)
mkdir -p "$_DESIGN_DIR"
echo "DESIGN_DIR: $_DESIGN_DIR"
```

Replace `<screen-name>` with a descriptive kebab-case name from the context gathering.

### Step 3a: Concept Generation

Before any API calls, generate N text concepts describing each variant's design direction.
Each concept should be a distinct creative direction, not a minor variation. Present them
as a lettered list:

```
I'll explore 3 directions:

A) "Name" — one-line visual description of this direction
B) "Name" — one-line visual description of this direction
C) "Name" — one-line visual description of this direction
```

Draw on DESIGN.md, taste memory, and the user's request to make each concept distinct.

### Step 3b: Concept Confirmation

Present options to the user to confirm before spending API credits:

> "These are the {N} directions I'll generate. Each takes ~60s, but I'll run them all
> in parallel so total time is ~60 seconds regardless of count."

Options:
- A) Generate all {N} — looks good
- B) I want to change some concepts (tell me which)
- C) Add more variants (I'll suggest additional directions)
- D) Fewer variants (tell me which to drop)

If B: incorporate feedback, re-present concepts, re-confirm. Max 2 rounds.
If C: add concepts, re-present, re-confirm.
If D: drop specified concepts, re-present, re-confirm.

### Step 3c: Parallel Generation

**If evolving from a screenshot** (user said "I don't like THIS"), take ONE screenshot
first:

```bash
playwright-cli screenshot --filename="$_DESIGN_DIR/current.png"
```

**Launch N Agent subagents in a single message** (parallel execution). Use the Agent
tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for each variant. Each agent is independent
and handles its own generation, quality check, verification, and retry.

**Important: # Design tool not available: path propagation.** The `$D` variable from DESIGN SETUP is a shell
variable that agents do NOT inherit. Substitute the resolved absolute path (from the
design context) into each agent prompt.

**Agent prompt template** (one per variant, substitute all `{...}` values):

```
Generate a design variant and save it.

Design binary: {absolute path to # Design tool not available: binary}
Brief: {the full variant-specific brief for this direction}
Output: /tmp/variant-{letter}.png
Final location: {_DESIGN_DIR absolute path}/variant-{letter}.png

Steps:
1. Run: {# Design tool not available: path} generate --brief "{brief}" --output /tmp/variant-{letter}.png
2. If the command fails with a rate limit error (429 or "rate limit"), wait 5 seconds
   and retry. Up to 3 retries.
3. If the output file is missing or empty after the command succeeds, retry once.
4. Copy: cp /tmp/variant-{letter}.png {_DESIGN_DIR}/variant-{letter}.png
5. Quality check: {# Design tool not available: path} check --image {_DESIGN_DIR}/variant-{letter}.png --brief "{brief}"
   If quality check fails, retry generation once.
6. Verify: ls -lh {_DESIGN_DIR}/variant-{letter}.png
7. Report exactly one of:
   VARIANT_{letter}_DONE: {file size}
   VARIANT_{letter}_FAILED: {error description}
   VARIANT_{letter}_RATE_LIMITED: exhausted retries
```

For the evolve path, replace step 1 with:
```
{# Design tool not available: path} evolve --screenshot {_DESIGN_DIR}/current.png --brief "{brief}" --output /tmp/variant-{letter}.png
```

**Why /tmp/ then cp?** In observed sessions, `# Design mockup generation not available in pi-agents --output .pi/...`
failed with "The operation was aborted" while `--output /tmp/...` succeeded. This is
a sandbox restriction. Always generate to `/tmp/` first, then `cp`.

### Step 3d: Results

After all agents complete:

1. Read each generated PNG inline (Read tool) so the user sees all variants at once.
2. Report status: "All {N} variants generated in ~{actual time}. {successes} succeeded,
   {failures} failed."
3. For any failures: report explicitly with the error. Do NOT silently skip.
4. If zero variants succeeded: fall back to sequential generation (one at a time with
   `# Design mockup generation not available in pi-agents`, showing each as it lands). Tell the user: "Parallel generation failed
   (likely rate limiting). Falling back to sequential..."
5. Proceed to Step 4 (comparison board).

**Dynamic image list for comparison board:** When proceeding to Step 4, construct the
image list from whatever variant files actually exist, not a hardcoded A/B/C list:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
_IMAGES=$(ls "$_DESIGN_DIR"/variant-*.png 2>/dev/null | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

Use `$_IMAGES` in the `# Design comparison not available in pi-agents --images` command.

## Step 4: Comparison Board + Feedback Loop

### Comparison Board + Feedback Loop

Create the comparison board and serve it over HTTP:

```bash
# Design comparison not available in pi-agents --images "$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-A.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-B.png,$_DESIGN_DIR/variant-C.png" --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html" --serve
```

This command generates the board HTML, starts an HTTP server on a random port,
and opens it in the user's default browser. **Run it in the background** with `&`
because the agent needs to keep running while the user interacts with the board.

**IMPORTANT: Reading feedback via file polling (not stdout):**

The server writes feedback to files next to the board HTML. The agent polls for these:
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json` — written when user clicks Submit (final choice)
- `$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json` — written when user clicks Regenerate/Remix/More Like This

**Polling loop** (run after launching `# Design serve not available in pi-agents` in background):

```bash
# Poll for feedback files every 5 seconds (up to 10 minutes)
for i in $(seq 1 120); do
  if [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json" ]; then
    echo "SUBMIT_RECEIVED"
    cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback.json"
    break
  elif [ -f "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json" ]; then
    echo "REGENERATE_RECEIVED"
    cat "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
    rm "$_DESIGN_DIR/feedback-pending.json"
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

The feedback JSON has this shape:
```json
{
  "preferred": "A",
  "ratings": { "A": 4, "B": 3, "C": 2 },
  "comments": { "A": "Love the spacing" },
  "overall": "Go with A, bigger CTA",
  "regenerated": false
}
```

**If `feedback-pending.json` found (`"regenerated": true`):**
1. Read `regenerateAction` from the JSON (`"different"`, `"match"`, `"more_like_B"`,
   `"remix"`, or custom text)
2. If `regenerateAction` is `"remix"`, read `remixSpec` (e.g. `{"layout":"A","colors":"B"}`)
3. Generate new variants with `# Design iterate not available in pi-agents` or `# Design variant generation not available in pi-agents` using updated brief
4. Create new board: `# Design comparison not available in pi-agents --images "..." --output "$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html"`
5. Parse the port from the `# Design serve not available in pi-agents` stderr output (`SERVE_STARTED: port=XXXXX`),
   then reload the board in the user's browser (same tab):
   `curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:PORT/api/reload -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"html":"$_DESIGN_DIR/design-board.html"}'`
6. The board auto-refreshes. **Poll again** for the next feedback file.
7. Repeat until `feedback.json` appears (user clicked Submit).

**If `feedback.json` found (`"regenerated": false`):**
1. Read `preferred`, `ratings`, `comments`, `overall` from the JSON
2. Proceed with the approved variant

**If `# Design serve not available in pi-agents` fails or no feedback within 10 minutes:** Fall back to ask the user:
"I've opened the design board. Which variant do you prefer? Any feedback?"

**After receiving feedback (any path):** Output a clear summary confirming
what was understood:

"Here's what I understood from your feedback:
PREFERRED: Variant [X]
RATINGS: [list]
YOUR NOTES: [comments]
DIRECTION: [overall]

Is this right?"

Present options to the user to verify before proceeding.

**Save the approved choice:**
```bash
echo '{"approved_variant":"<V>","feedback":"<FB>","date":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","screen":"<SCREEN>","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)'"}' > "$_DESIGN_DIR/approved.json"
```

## Step 5: Feedback Confirmation

After receiving feedback (via HTTP POST or ask the user fallback), output a clear
summary confirming what was understood:

"Here's what I understood from your feedback:

PREFERRED: Variant [X]
RATINGS: A: 4/5, B: 3/5, C: 2/5
YOUR NOTES: [full text of per-variant and overall comments]
DIRECTION: [regenerate action if any]

Is this right?"

Present options to the user to confirm before saving.

## Step 6: Save & Next Steps

Write `approved.json` to `$_DESIGN_DIR/` (handled by the loop above).

If invoked from another skill: return the structured feedback for that skill to consume.
The calling skill reads `approved.json` and the approved variant PNG.

If standalone, offer next steps by asking the user:

> "Design direction locked in. What's next?
> A) Iterate more — refine the approved variant with specific feedback
> B) Implement — start building from this design
> C) Save to plan — add this as an approved mockup reference in the current plan
> D) Done — I'll use this later"

## Important Rules

1. **Never save to `.context/`, `docs/designs/`, or `/tmp/`.** All design artifacts go
   to `.pi/reports/designs/`. This is enforced. See DESIGN_SETUP above.
2. **Show variants inline before opening the board.** The user should see designs
   immediately in their terminal. The browser board is for detailed feedback.
3. **Confirm feedback before saving.** Always summarize what you understood and verify.
4. **Taste memory is automatic.** Prior approved designs inform new generations by default.
5. **Two rounds max on context gathering.** Don't over-interrogate. Proceed with assumptions.
6. **DESIGN.md is the default constraint.** Unless the user says otherwise.
